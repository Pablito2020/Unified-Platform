* TODO (questions):
** Exceptions:
- [ ] Nif: BadFormatNifException is checked (because the user can send a bad parametter and the application could catch the exception).
- [ ] Nif: If string is null, should we send our own exception? Or we can use the NullPointerException from java? + It makes sense that te exception is unchecked, because it is a programmer fault, not the user.
- [ ] PIN: Is pin only a number?

* TODO (work):
- [ ]
