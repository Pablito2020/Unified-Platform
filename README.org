* Execute Tests ðŸ§ª:
You can run the tests with IntelliJ or with maven.

** With IntelliJ:
Go to the src/test/java package, right click and select the "execute tests" option.

** With Maven:
Make sure that you have the Java Path exported. The JDK version should be 17. In case you have to configure it in linux you can do:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/
#+END_SRC

After that, go to the root of the project and execute:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ mvn test
#+END_SRC



* Contributing ðŸ’¬:
Before contributing, see the [[https://github.com/Pablito2020/Unified-Platform/issues][issues]] page for knowing which changes/improvements can be made to the project. After you choose the problem you want to fix, you have to assign yourself to the issue.

After that, create a new branch with your name (for example: pablo), and then commit to it. After all the changes are done, you can nominate to all the members inside the issue and then they will give you the okay to merge your branch to develop.
